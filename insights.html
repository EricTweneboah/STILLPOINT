            <h2>How to rebuild confidence after major life change</h2>
            <p>
              After a major life event, confidence often drops because identity feels uncertain.
              Instead of pushing yourself to "feel better fast," focus on visible proof that you can trust yourself again.
            </p>
            <p>
              Confidence returns through evidence, not pressure. Begin with actions that are small, clear, and repeatable.
              Keep your standards realistic while staying consistent.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Choose one promise to keep daily, even if it is only ten minutes.</li>
              <li>Track completed actions to build self-trust through evidence.</li>
              <li>Replace harsh self-talk with grounded, factual reflection.</li>
              <li>Review progress weekly and increase challenge gradually.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The goal is not perfection. The goal is momentum with self-respect.

            <h2>What to do when you feel stuck but cannot explain why</h2>
            <p>
              Feeling stuck often means your attention is split across too many demands.
              The answer is not more effort. It is better structure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use a one-week reset: define one priority, remove one non-essential obligation, and protect one focused action block each day.
              This creates immediate mental space and restores direction.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Write one sentence: "This week, what matters most is..."</li>
              <li>Cancel, defer, or delegate one draining commitment.</li>
              <li>Schedule your top task in your highest-energy hour.</li>
              <li>End each day with a short review of what moved forward.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Progress becomes easier when your week reflects your values.

            <h2>Empty nest, new identity: creating purpose again</h2>
            <p>
              When your daily parenting role shifts, the emotional gap can feel surprising.
              This season is not an ending. It is a redesign point.
            </p>
            <p>
              Purpose returns when your calendar reflects who you are becoming, not only who you were.
              Build your routine around energy, connection, and meaningful challenge.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create weekly anchors: movement, social connection, and personal growth.</li>
              <li>Set one medium-term goal that is entirely your own.</li>
              <li>Reconnect with interests that were paused during full-time parenting.</li>
              <li>Use coaching accountability to stay consistent through uncertainty.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Identity does not disappear. It evolves when you give it room.
